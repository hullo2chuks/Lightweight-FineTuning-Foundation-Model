# Lightweight FineTuning Foundation-Model

Applying parameter-efficient fine-tuning using the Hugging Face peft library to `distilbert-base-uncased` foundation model


## Description
This project brings together all of the essential components of a PyTorch + Hugging Face training and inference process. Specifically, it will:

* Load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance
* Perform parameter-efficient fine tuning using the pre-trained model
* Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model
